<h1>🛠️ GearGuard: rawWork Branch</h1>
Welcome to the engine room of GearGuard. This branch contains the foundational logic, backend integrations, and core functional workflows of the maintenance tracker.
<br><br>
<h2>🧠 The Philosophy: "Function over Form"</h2>
In this branch, we followed a strict Logic-First development strategy. Our primary goal was to ensure that the "plumbing" of the application was rock-solid before investing time in aesthetics.

We prioritized:
1)System Architecture: Establishing the handshake between React (Vite), Flask, and MongoDB.

2)Workflow Integrity: Implementing the complex "Auto-fill" logic, "Scrap" triggers, and state transitions for the Kanban board.

3)Data Persistence: Ensuring every maintenance request and equipment update was accurately reflected in the database.

<h2>🛠️ Development Phases</h2>
Phase 1: The Skeleton: Built rough, unstyled components to verify CRUD operations for Equipment, Teams, and Requests.

Phase 2: The Logic: Coded the business rules for the "Breakdown" and "Routine Checkup" flows, ensuring the system felt "alive."

Phase 3: AI-Assisted Polishing (Next Step): Once the functionality was 100% verified in this branch, we moved to the main branch to "beautify" the UI, leveraging AI to speed up CSS/Tailwind styling and component refinement.

<h2>🚦 Why this Branch?</h2>
This branch serves as the technical proof-of-concept. It represents our commitment to building a product that doesn't just look good, but works perfectly. Here, you will find minimal styling but maximum functionality.

Note: For the final, polished UI/UX version, please switch to the main branch.
